# python-challenge
I used https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_functions.asp to look up python built-in functions like Sorted, Round, and Set
I worked with Classmates Jeremy and Sophia to trouble shoot initial method of count() vs len() and otherwise ended up solving everything myself.

The executable in both PyBank and PyPoll are main.py
